        <h2>jQuery Interview Questions and Answers</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h3>1. What is C#?</h3>
                <p>C# is an object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft. It is designed for developing apps that run on the .NET framework.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>2. What is the difference between `public`, `private`, `protected`, and `internal` access modifiers?</h3>
                <p>`public`: Accessible from anywhere; `private`: Accessible only within the class; `protected`: Accessible within the class and by derived class instances; `internal`: Accessible only within the same assembly.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>3. What is an abstract class in C#?</h3>
                <p>An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated and is meant to be inherited by other classes. It can contain abstract methods with no implementation.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>4. What is the difference between an interface and an abstract class?</h3>
                <p>An interface contains only method declarations with no implementations. An abstract class can have both abstract and non-abstract methods.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>5. What is polymorphism in C#?</h3>
                <p>Polymorphism allows methods to have different behaviors based on the object that invokes them. It is achieved through method overloading and overriding.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>6. What is encapsulation?</h3>
                <p>Encapsulation is the concept of bundling data (variables) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, typically a class. It also restricts access to certain components using access modifiers.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>7. What are delegates in C#?</h3>
                <p>A delegate is a type that represents references to methods. It is used to pass methods as arguments to other methods.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>8. What is the difference between `String` and `StringBuilder` in C#?</h3>
                <p>`String` is immutable, meaning once created, its value cannot be changed. `StringBuilder` is mutable and allows modification without creating a new instance.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>9. What is LINQ?</h3>
                <p>LINQ (Language-Integrated Query) is a feature that allows querying of collections and databases in a readable, SQL-like syntax, integrated directly into C# code.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>10. What is the `async` and `await` keyword used for in C#?</h3>
                <p>The `async` keyword defines an asynchronous method, and `await` is used to pause the method execution until the awaited task completes, making it easy to write asynchronous code.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>11. Explain the difference between `==` and `Equals()` in C#.</h3>
                <p>The `==` operator compares object references, while the `Equals()` method compares the values of the objects.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>12. What is the difference between `throw` and `throw ex` in exception handling?</h3>
                <p>`throw` rethrows the original exception, preserving the stack trace. `throw ex` resets the stack trace, which makes it harder to debug.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>13. What is a `sealed` class in C#?</h3>
                <p>A `sealed` class cannot be inherited. It is used when you want to prevent other classes from inheriting its functionality.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>14. What are extension methods in C#?</h3>
                <p>Extension methods allow you to add new methods to existing types without modifying them. They are defined as static methods but are called as if they are instance methods.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>15. What is dependency injection?</h3>
                <p>Dependency injection is a design pattern used to achieve Inversion of Control (IoC) by passing dependencies into an object, instead of the object creating them itself, making the code more modular and testable.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>16. What is a constructor in C#?</h3>
                <p>A constructor is a special method that is automatically called when an object is created. It is used to initialize the objectâ€™s properties.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>17. What is garbage collection in C#?</h3>
                <p>Garbage collection in C# is the process of automatically reclaiming memory that is no longer in use, freeing up resources and optimizing memory management.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>18. What are the types of inheritance supported by C#?</h3>
                <p>C# supports single inheritance, multiple inheritance through interfaces, multilevel inheritance, and hierarchical inheritance.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
